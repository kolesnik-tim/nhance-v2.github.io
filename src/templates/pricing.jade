In addition to this customers pay a nominal one time fee for every DX Card that is issued. We generate an invoice at the end of each month which displays the Monthly Usage Fee slab considered for the month and the number of DX Card issued and the price for each DX Card. The price of DX Card is determined based on the industry segment that you belong to.
