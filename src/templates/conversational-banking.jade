                b Digital KYC
              p Acquiring new customers in banking requires a significant amount of sales effort with multiple outbound calls and follow ups often required to close a sale. Several customers will have similar questions about a financial product which often need to be addressed by an executive. With the Banking Bot, multiple customers can interact with a single bot at a time convenient to them. Apart from providing information, the bot can also be configured to follow-up with a prospect. Once a new customer is acquired, KYC can also be done digitally over WhatsApp.

              p Basic account functions like checking balance, statement requests, blocking a card, etc. can be enabled through WhatsApp providing the customer with convenience. In case of unfortunate events like fraud or loss of card, the customer is saved from long wait times and can instantly get his card blocked through a WhatsApp text. To put it simply, the customer is always connected instantly over WhatsApp.

              p This is one area where the Banking Bot can really put things into perspective for customers as well as the bank. With WhatsApp, information can be instantly shared with the customer and requests/complaints can be taken in real-time. This saves a lot of time for the customer, and also a lot of effort for the bank. IVRs, long hold times and waiting for ticket responses are things of the past. Give your customer instant support at any time of the day through WhatsApp.
